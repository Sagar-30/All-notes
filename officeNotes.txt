cloud Firestore:
It stores data in format: collection(collection of many document) -> document(collection of data) -> data

Note: when connection establish between client and server there is a listener on client which detects any changes inside database 
      and a process in database which detects any changes inside client.
 **   When client render first time it first stores the data inside localStorage cache and then render it. it does no directly renderd it. 
 **   Same when something changes in client it stores in localStorage cache and then listener will be notified then it add into firebase.
 **   if something added new from one client it notify all connected devices in real time.

## Offline support: As it first storing data in local cache if internet connection goes off in between so app will not crash because 
                   it will start continue to adding data in local cache and as soon as we come online data will be sync to the firebase database.

_____________Add firestore to app

1). Create new project in firestore console.
2). Add config file to the app.

3). import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";       //Add this also in config file because we are using firestore
   export const db = getFirestore(app);                           // app is what we are exporting from config it can be different

4). Add data:

import {db} from "firestore.js";
import { collection, addDoc } from "firebase/firestore"; 


await addDoc(collection(db, "blogs"), {
        title: title,
        description: description,
